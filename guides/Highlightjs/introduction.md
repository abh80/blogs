# Highlight.js

Many people uses code blocks in their site without syntax highlighting which is not good for viewers to understand the codes and will not be neat to look over up. So we use [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/)

> There are some alternatives for highlightjs, one of them is [Prismjs](https://prismjs.com/).
